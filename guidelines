##Data was cleaned using the code in data_cleaning_code.py
## You can view the report before and after cleaning
## I will share the accident_clean on drive.



-------------------------------------------------------How to work-------------------------------------------------------
-->Pick all date and time elements and combine them
-->USe date time index for uniform sorting of data across team
-->Plot Data(Number of accidents) againist time and plot
--->Receive date day , year and TIme dynamically

##ALL PLOTS MUST SORT DATA WITH DATETIME DYNAMICALLY 
##Use time range from above slots
## Use specific time or dates for plots with a max of 5 times selected individually for the sake of space
## Number of accident vs quality that has meaning to road safety eg weather , road etc depending on allocation
## Get necessary means(averages) for cards, plot bar graphs for categorical data, plot line graphs, and also combo (line and bar)
## You can also plot historgrams for the necessary.
## Pick a max of 3 comparisons to graph your data but if data preses you can do more
## Keep code simple as possible.
